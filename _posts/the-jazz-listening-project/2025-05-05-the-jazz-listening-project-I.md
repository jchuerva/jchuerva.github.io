**What is it?**  
This is a guided listening journey through jazz history, centered around the saxophone but expanding into the full evolution of the genre. **The goal**: train your ear, deepen your intuition, and learn to *hear* the jazz languageâ€”not just play it. 


Weâ€™ll begin before bebop, with foundational swing-era players, and move through bebop, hard bop, modal, free, and modern styles. These 15 albums are not just classicsâ€”they are blueprints for phrasing, tone, improvisation, and interplay.

### How to Use This List

- Listen actively: headphones, no multitasking.
- Revisit each album multiple times, focusing on different musical elements.
- Compare styles, tones, and improvisational approaches.
- Use the same albums to transcribe, imitate, and internalize ideas.
